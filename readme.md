### Udacity Project 1
#### First Neural Network

This is a project from Udacity's Deep Learning course. Here we take bike rental data and feed it through our neural network to predict bike sharing rides.

#### Graphs!
Some graphs of the outcomes. I found that 5000 epochs and 7 hidden nodes worked well for training.


#### Installation Instructions
Ensure you have anaconda or miniconda downloaded.
Clone this repo and cd into the dlnd-your-first-network folder.

Create a new conda environment:
  `conda create --name dlnd python=3`

Enter your new environment:
Mac/Linux: >> `source activate dlnd`
Windows: >> `activate dlnd`
Your console prompt should look something like:
`(dlnd) [dlnd-your-first-network]$ `

Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following, from the sourced environment:
  `conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

Run the following to open up the notebook:
  `jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb`
